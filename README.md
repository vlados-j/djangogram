<h1>Djangogram.</h1>

In terms of functionality, Djangogram is a project comparable to Instagram. By using their email, users can sign up for the website. The user will receive a confirmation of registration with a unique link to the email. The user will be taken to his profile page where he can add his full name, bio, and avatar after clicking on a link. Next, the user can use DjangoGram.

The user can upload images to posts and view those of other users via a feed of the most recent posts. Guests who are not permitted cannot view a user's profile or images.
There may be several photos in each post. There can be several tags in one post. Authors can also add new tags. Users can also like posts (and unlike as well).
